# Ascerex Website

Ascerex is an aerospace technology and systems initiative focused on building advanced, scalable infastructure at the intersection of software, autonomous navigation, and transportation. 

This repository serves as the primary public web presence and foundational codebase for Ascerex.

## Purpose

The goals of this repository are to:

- Host the Ascerex public website
- Establish a clean, version-controlled development workflow
- Provide a stable foundation for future expansion into additional systems and services

This repository is intentionally minimal at the start and will evolve as the platform grows.


## Roadmap

- Initial public landing page
- Mission and systems overview
- Newsroom and updates
- Contact and partnership channels
- Expansion into additional Ascerex sub-projects
